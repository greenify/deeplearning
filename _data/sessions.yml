  title: "Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing"
  description: "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an important part of many real world applications used by most people in our society today. Most prominent examples are automatic machine translation, search engines, or speech recognition. In this talk I will give a short overview over existing NLP applications and the challenges they still face. Following that, I will show the application of deep learning techniques to two important NLP tasks: language modelling and sentiment analysis."
